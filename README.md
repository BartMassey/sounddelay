# sounddelay -- audio delay line
Copyright &copy; 2008-2014 Bart Massey

This program is a simple command-line audio delay line for
WAVE format audio files.  There is precious little
documentation at this point; that needs to be fixed soon.
However, I think it's a nice demo app for my
[WAVE](http://github.com/BartMassey/WAVE) library.
